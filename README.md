**Spam Email Classifier**<br>
This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham. It provides a comprehensive solution for building, training, and using a text classifier.

**Functionality**<br>
This script offers the following functionalities:<br>

**Data Preprocessing**: It reads email data from a CSV file named "mail_data.csv", assuming it contains columns for "Message" (email text) and "Category" (spam or ham label). It handles missing values and converts categorical labels ("spam" and "ham") into numerical labels (0 for spam, 1 for ham).<br>
Feature Extraction: It utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert email text into numerical features. TF-IDF considers the importance of a word within a document and across the entire document corpus. It removes common English stop words and converts all text to lowercase for better feature representation.<br>
Model Building: It employs Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm, to learn the relationship between the TF-IDF features and email categories. The model is trained on a portion of the data (training set) to establish this relationship.<br>
Model Evaluation: It evaluates the trained model's performance on both the training data and a separate testing set (unseen data). It calculates accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen emails.<br>
Model Saving: It saves the trained model as a pickle file ("model_pickle") for future use. This allows you to avoid retraining the model every time you want to classify new emails.<br>
User Input Prediction: The script allows you to enter a message, and it will predict whether the message is classified as spam or not spam using the saved model.<br>
Benefits<br>
This project offers several benefits:<br>

**Effective Spam Filtering**: It helps you filter out spam emails from your inbox, improving email organization and security.<br>
Customizable: You can train the model on your own email data to improve its accuracy for your specific needs.<br>
Reusable Model: The saved model allows for quick and efficient spam/ham classification of new emails without retraining the entire model.<br>
Educational: This project provides a practical example of building and using a machine learning model for text classification.<br>
Getting Started<br>
**Prerequisites:**<br>

Python 3.x<br>
pandas library (pip install pandas)<br>
scikit-learn library (pip install scikit-learn)<br>
pickle library (usually included in Python installation)<br>
Instructions:<br>

Instructions:<br>
**Data Preparation:**<br>
Replace the sample "mail_data.csv" file with your actual CSV file containing labeled emails (spam/ham). Ensure the data has columns named "Message" and "Category".<br>
Running the Script:<br>
Execute the Python script (assuming it's named spam_classifier.py).<br>
The script will perform the following tasks:<br>
Train the model on the provided data.<br>
Evaluate the model's performance on both training and testing sets.<br>
Allow you to enter messages for spam/ham classification.<br>
Saving and Loading the Model:<br>
The trained model is saved as "model_pickle".<br>
The script demonstrates loading the saved model for future predictions.<br>
